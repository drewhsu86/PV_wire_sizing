The purpose of this project is to help Electrical Engineers quickly determine the necessary wire sizes for a current-carrying conductor that is typically used in a solar PV (photovoltaic) project. The wire gauge (thickness) is dependent on a great number of variables, including the current, material (copper or aluminum), rated temperature (in degrees Celcius) and more.

The interface should be self evident to electrical engineers who are looking to use the tool for its intended purpose, as the input boxes are all applicably labeled (with the proper units). Users need to convert their values to the units used by the tool to get accurate results.

"Print Page" button opens the print dialog of the browser so the correct results may be saved.

"Add Wire" button computes the wire calculation results, and then prints them as a new entry on the bottom of the page. Existing results can be deleted, especially if the voltage drop or other values are not compatible with the engineering. Each entry comes with a "Delete Entry" button.
